# About Platelet Count (Source: Quest Diagnostics)
Platelets are the smallest type of cell found in the blood. Platelets help stop bleeding after an injury by gathering around the injury site, plugging the hole in the bleeding vessel and helping the blood to clot more quickly. Platelet counts may be done if you are prone to bruising or if you are about to have surgery. The platelet count may change with bleeding disorders, heart disease, diabetes and inflammatory disorders.
# Low Platelet Count (Source: https://www.mountsinai.org/health-library/tests/platelet-count)
A low platelet count is below 150,000 (150 × 109/L). If your platelet count is below 50,000 (50 × 109/L), your risk for bleeding is higher. Even every day activities can cause bleeding.

A lower-than-normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. Low platelet count can be divided into 3 main causes:

- Not enough platelets are being made in the bone marrow
- Platelets are being destroyed in the bloodstream
- Platelets are being destroyed in the spleen or liver

# My story!!
I am a software engineer by profession. In general, I am curious and inquisitive about data; especially when the data means something to me, at a personal level. That is exactly what happened to me, when a few months ago, my doctor found out through lab tests that my platelet count had dropped in the last year, and she wanted me to see a hematologist. She wanted to find out if I had thrombocytopenia (a medical condition causing low platelet count)?

I wanted to know how worrisome are my results? And the statistician inside me wanted to answer that same question a bit more quantitatively. I was infact, too excited to apply some statistical techniques and tools that I had recently learnt in a statistics course.

# How many data points?
When you start analyzing health data, you are hit by the reality that it may be too small. What that means is that central limit theorem(CLT) may not kick-in.

I had 16 data points of platelet count collected over past 3-4 years, which is obviously too small. You need the i.i.d(identical independent) assumption and atleast 30 data points to apply CLT.
