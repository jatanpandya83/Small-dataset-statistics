# Platelet Count
A platelet count is a lab test to measure how many platelets you have in your blood. Platelets are parts of the blood that help the blood clot. They are smaller than red or white blood cells.
What Abnormal Results Mean
# LOW PLATELET COUNT
A low platelet count is below 150,000 (150 × 109/L). If your platelet count is below 50,000 (50 × 109/L), your risk for bleeding is higher. Even every day activities can cause bleeding.

A lower-than-normal platelet count is called thrombocytopenia. Low platelet count can be divided into 3 main causes:

- Not enough platelets are being made in the bone marrow
- Platelets are being destroyed in the bloodstream
- Platelets are being destroyed in the spleen or liver
